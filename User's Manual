Austyn Washington 2/2/20 Project 1

User’s Manual:
Once in the Linux Server, run make clean main, then ./main. The project will read the contents of lastNames.txt
and place them in an array of reference then the data is taken and placed into Raw.txt, then the data of Raw.txt 
is read then encrypted and placed the data into Encrypted.txt. The data is read in Main and placed into the hash 
table. What will print to screen is the first five contents tested from the Encrypted.txt to see if found, if they aren’t, 
then what will print is not found. After that dummy passwords are placed and tested to find and search the objects with 
the same UserID’s in the file of Encrypted.txt. Will return results not found and follow the functionality stated
earlier.
